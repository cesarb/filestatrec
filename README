gitstatrec - record mtime and mode for files in a git repository


The git tree format, as used by git-annex, records only a minimum amount
of per-file metadata. When recording more metadata is a requirement, it
has to be recorded out of band; gitstatrec records it in a hidden text
file (.filestat). Currently it records the file's mode and modification
time.

The file format is designed to make it easy to manually resolve merge
conflicts, which is why it's a simple text file. Since merge drivers
usually treat each line of text as an indivisible unit, the metadata for
each file is stored in a single line. To minimize accidental conflicts,
the file is sorted by the file path; to make it more readable during
merges, unusual characters are escaped.


Why not tags?

Both git and git-annex are content-addressed filesystems, so two files
with the same content map to the same object, even if their metadata
should be different.
